About
=====

In order to unify the key mapping across different keyboard, this xmodmap setup
divides the key definitions across several files. By maintaining common mappings
separate from the keyboard-specific ones, we get easier maintance (e.g.,
changing common key mappings) at the cost of a slightly more complicated setup.

Files
=====

common
    Defines keycodes and keysyms that are common across all keyboard layouts.

control
    Defines control keys like Alt, Control, Shift, etc.

layouts
    Contains keyboard-specific keycodes and keysyms

Usage
=====

1) Load the common keys:

    xmodmap .xmodmap/common

2) Load the keyboard-specific keys:
    
    xmodmap .xmodmap/layouts/foo

3) Load the control keys:

    xmodmap .xmodmap/control
